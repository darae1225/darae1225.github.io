          <p>I have been working as an operation officer at a start-up telehealth company, DoctorAI, since 2021. My main role was to establish the business by managing and overseeing the day to day operation as well as handling of administration/customer support duties. In 2022, I was involved in developing the website and application working with software engineers.

          I genuinely enjoyed working alongside software engineers designing and building the products by making a small progress each and everyday. I started learning about computer languages - html, css and javascript - by utilising free online learning materials and resources.
