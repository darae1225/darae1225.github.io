          <p>I have been working as an operation officer at a start-up telehealth company, DoctorAI, since 2021. I was initially involved in establishing the business by managing the day to day operation as well as handling of admin/customer support duties. I volunteered to get involved in the development of new website and appication which was launced successfully in 2024.

          I genuinely enjoyed working with software engineers designing and building the products by making a small progress each and everyday. I started learning about computer languages - html, css and javascript - by utilising currently available online learning materials and resources.
